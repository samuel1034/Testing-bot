# **ISIPay Web Module Testing**

This repository contains automated tests for ISIPayâ€™s web module, covering essential functionality including login, registration, 2FA, Google Sign-In, KYC, password recovery, and crypto transactions. Using Python and Selenium WebDriver, these tests interact with the ISIPay web application to validate usability and functionality, capturing screenshots and logging results in a Word document for analysis.

## **Features**

* **Login and Registration Testing:** Tests login, Google Sign-In, account creation, and 2FA workflows.
* User Authentication: Verifies 2FA, password recovery, and email receipt processes.
* Crypto Transactions: Tests sending/receiving crypto, viewing transaction history, and P2P interactions.
* User Interface: Validates buttons, menus, and critical UI elements.
* Prerequisites
Python 3.10+: Ensure Python is installed and in your PATH.

* Selenium: Install Selenium with pip install selenium.

* Chrome WebDriver: Place the chromedriver.exe in your system path or specify its location in the script.
docx Module: Install with pip install python-docx.
